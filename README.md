Controller for Vibrotactile Armbands
===================================

The code contained in this project was used to control vibrotactile armbands by sending commands to a respective microcontroller via Bluetooth LE.

The Bluetooth connection was set up using the device specific Android Settings. However this Project also contains code that can be used to establish a connection in the Application itself.

I took the original Android BluetoothLeChat Sample from https://github.com/android/connectivity-samples/tree/main/BluetoothLeChat and modified it to my needs.
